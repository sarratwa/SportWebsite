# big.js #

A small, fast JavaScript library for arbitrary-precision decimal arithmetic.

The little sister to [bignumber.js](https://github.com/MikeMcl/bignumber.js/).
See also [decimal.js](https://github.com/MikeMcl/decimal.js/), and [here](https://github.com/MikeMcl/big.js/wiki) for the difference between them.

## Features

  - Faster, smaller and easier-to-use than JavaScript versions of Java's BigDecimal
  - Only 2.7 KB minified and gzipped
  - Simple API
  - Replicates the `toExponential`, `toFixed` and `toPrecision` methods of JavaScript's Number type
  - Includes a `sqrt` method
  - Stores values in an accessible decimal floating point format
  - No dependencies
  - Comprehensive [documentation](http://mikemcl.github.io/big.js/) and test set

## Load

The library is the single JavaScript file *big.js* (or *big.min.js*, which is *big.js* minified).

It can be loaded via a script tag in an HTML document for the browser

    <script src='./relative/path/to/big.js'></script>

or as a CommonJS, [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) or AMD module using `require`.

    var Big = require('big.js');

For Node.js, the library is available from the npm registry:

    $ npm install big.js



## Use

*In all examples below, `var`, semicolons and `toString` calls are not shown.
If a commented-out value is in quotes it means `toString` has been called on the preceding expression.*

The library exports a single function: Big, the construc
